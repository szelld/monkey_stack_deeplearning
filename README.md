Task:
Our task is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately identifying malignant skin cancer from medical images. This involves preparing and organizing the dataset, training a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras, and optimizing the model for high accuracy. The goal is to create a reliable tool that can assist in early detection of skin cancer.
